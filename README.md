# Markdown Previewer

This is a Pomodoro Clock built with React, designed to help users manage their time effectively using the Pomodoro technique. The app provides a customizable timer for work sessions (Pomodoros) and breaks, helping users stay focused and productive.

## Features

- Customizable Timers: Users can set the duration for work sessions (Pomodoros) and breaks (both short and long breaks) according to their preferences.
- Start, Pause, and Reset Controls: The app allows users to start, pause, and reset the timer as needed, providing flexibility during work sessions.
- Session and Break Indicators: The timer displays whether the current session is a work session or a break, ensuring that users can easily keep track of their time.
- Audio Alerts: When a session ends, an audio alert is played to notify the user that it's time to take a break or start the next session.
- Responsive Design: The app is fully responsive, working seamlessly on different devices and screen sizes.
